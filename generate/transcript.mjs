					'_',
					' '

					' '
				)} offers a deep, analytical perspective. The dialogue should be engaging and include light humor, yet still provide meaningful insights into ${topic}. Limit the dialogue to a maximum of ${duration * 7
					} exchanges, aiming for a concise transcript that would last between ${duration} minutes. The person attribute should either be ${agentA} or ${agentB}. The line attribute should be that character's line of dialogue. I also need an asset description under the asset attribute which would be a relevant search query to find an image which should be relevant to the overall topic of the conversation. The asset descriptions shouldn't be vague, but a description of something that you think would be a good image to go along with the conversation. Specificity is key. The JSON format WHICH MUST BE ADHERED TO ALWAYS is as follows: { transcript: { [ {'person': 'the exact value of ${agentA} or ${agentB} depending on who is talking', 'line': 'their line of conversation in the dialog', asset: 'relevant image generate query based on the current line'} ] } }`,
